                        <h2>Learning from teaching</h2>
						<p>In the following section, I describe what our group has done for our teaching session and what I have learned from preparation and implementation processes.</p>
                        <h3>Topic<br>Safety in Virtual environments. (Safety, equality, network bullying, others, laws…) Consider both from the viewpoint of the student and the teacher.</h3>
                        <p>This week’s topic, safety in virtual environment, is quite broad so we decided the focus areas as cyber hygiene, equality, cyber bullying and copyright.</p>
                        <h4>Cyber hygiene</h4>
                        <p>Cyber hygiene is a term which introduce the best practices and actions that a user can undertake to improve cybersecurity while engaging in online activities. Cyber hygiene includes three concepts: ethics, virtual safety and virtual security. Ethics refers to the moral choices which individuals make when using Internet-capable technologies and digital media. For example, it includes copyright, online etiquette, hacking and online addiction(s). Virtual safety indicates the actions individuals take to minimise the dangers they may encounter in virtual environment, such as, online predators, unwanted communications, viruses and spyware. Virtual security means the technical interventions that protect data, identity information, and hardware from unauthorised access or harm, such as antivirus software, internet content filters, firewalls and password protection. </p><p>In this digital era, all citizens should be instructed, like crossing the street safely, in order to protect ourselves. As a teacher, we have responsibility to make students understand possible danger in virtual environments and guide them to understand the right actions to encounter. </p>
                        <h4>Equality</h4>
                        <p>About equality, we researched the following three concepts. First concept is equal opportunity to access to the digital tools. The previous study described the factors which affect access to online learning are physical, experiential (digital literacy), social, economic, and institutional influences (Barraket, 2001). In the virtual environments, financial, experiential or institutional differences may broaden the gaps in opportunity to access to the technologies, such as devices or application software which support learning.</p>
                        <p>Second concept is equal opportunity to choose the digital tools. Educational technology which support learning has been developed but do we, as a student, have the right to choose the tools? When a learning platform is used in a course, do students have right not to use the tool? As a teacher, when the students don't want to provide their personal information to create their account in the platform, what should we do? There is no one clear answer, but we consider that students should not be forced to use digital tools for learning especially when it requires registration of personal info. And as a teacher, we should always have alternative ways for those students to achieve the same learning goals.</p>
                        <p>Third concept is equal participation in virtual learning environment. Compared to face-to-face settings, in virtual settings, it is easy to lurk (not contribute to discussion but just being a free-rider) as students are not working at the same time in the same place (Klemm, 2000). For example, when we physically facing each other, it is quite difficult to ignore someone’s question, but in virtual environments, one may choose not to reply to someone’s comments pretending that s/he is busy. At the same time, in virtual environments, discussion can be dominated easily by a few people. Some students may be shy, insecure, or not familiar with the topic. We, as a teacher or a student, should attention to every member’s equal participation and equal opportunity to learn. </p>
                        <h4>Cyber bullying</h4>
                        <p>As community in virtual environments grows as big as real environments, cyber bullying is serious problem which cause serious damage for individuals when it happens. For cyber bullying most of information we found was for teenagers. However, cyber bullying is not only for school kids but all for adults. The following tips are the ones we found to encounter cyber bullying. 1) As a teacher, educate yourself. It is important to know what tools/ social media your students use, and what kind of possible cyber bullying happen. 2) Be on the lookout for signs of cyberbullying: you may be the trusted adult a student turns to for help. Take it seriously. 3) Recognize the signs: does a student seem depressed, withdrawn? Are their grades suddenly dropping? 4) Ask students to report it: bullying stops when the bystanders speak up. 5) Respond to an incident: encourage the bullied not to erase the evidence by deleting the hurtful message from their wall or phone. Save screenshots. 6) Find the right response: those who bully need to understand the impact of their actions. Punishment is not the only solution and they can often benefit from counseling. 7) If applicable, get parents involved: their involvement / awareness of childrens’ / youths’ online activities is a must.</p>
                        <p>Regarding bullying, Finland developed and have used a successful anti-bullying program named <a href="http://www.kivaprogram.net/">KiVa</a>. It is a research based program which guide students and teachers to prevent and deal with bullying. The program is used not only in Finland but also in foreign countries, such as U.K. or Estonia.</p>
                        <h4>Copyright</h4>
                        <p>Copyright means the right of the creator of an artwork to determine how that work is used and to be credited as the creator of the work. Works of art include compositions, books, magazines, paintings, drawings, dance performances, etc. Copyright is based on national law and international treaties. Copyright in Finland is under the mandate of <a href="https://minedu.fi/en/copyright">the Ministry of Education and Culture</a>. In Finland, copyright remains for 70 years after the year of the author’s death. Copyright violations are punishable under Finnish law.<br>Copyright protects two types of rights. Economic rights concern how the artwork to be used including manufacturing copies of the work and making the work publicly available. Moral rights include the right to be acknowledged as the author to protect the connections of the author with the artwork.</p>
                        <p><b>Public copyright license</b> is a license which an author of the artwork (licensor) can grant additional copyright permissions to general public as licensees. By applying a public license to the artwork, the author give permission for others to copy or change their work under the defined condition. One of the major public copyright license is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/">Creative Commons</a>. Creative Commons license is a copyright license which aims to distribute creative work openly. It is common in every license in Creative Commons that the copyright will be retained in an author (licensor) while allowing others to copy, distribute, and derivate their work under chosen conditions. The author is able to define the condition, such as attribution, share-alike, non-derivative and non-commercial. It is possible to search CC artworks online, <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/29508?p=ws_images_usagerights&hl=en&visit_id=637038268755610726-629709426&rd=1">Google</a> (advance search/ tools> Usage rights), <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en">Youtube</a> (filter> features> Creative Commons)</p>
                        <p>Copyright is important from both teacher and students’ point of views. As a teacher, we should pay attention to the copyright, for example when we make lecture materials. We might want to use videos or images from internet which can be used in the lecture. I found Creative Commons has <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">HTML code</a> that I can embedded in my website to let visitors know the license type. I added my license in the bottom of my website. </p>
                        <p> I got to know that copyright issues are very complicated and there is no clear border line which determine good or bad use of copyright protected works. One of the reasons of the complication is that copyright laws have been made long time before the current digital age where artworks can be distributed and re-used easily. Another reason is that copyright laws differ in each country and it is hard to see what is good and bad use. But I found that it is always safe to use CC licensed works and I will use them for my teaching in the future. </p>
						<h3>Preparation for the lesson</h3>
                        <p>We divided our tasks in the early stage, as we knew that we do not have many chances to have meeting. We created google slides and roughly structured. Each member added the pages for the assigned themes. But we needed someone to edit and finalise the slides to keep them coherence. In the process, we needed to remove a lot from individuals’ work because there were too many stuff for 45 minutes teaching session. Removed contents were added as “useful links” at the end of the presentation. Fortunately, all of us were very understanding and we did not have obvious conflicts about the result of editing, still I would like to think about the ways to make the process of creating lesson more effective. </p>
                        <p>One of the challenges we face is that not all of us are familiar with the topic and it is hard to guess what we are going to talk about before doing some research. As the time for teaching is only a week and we all have some other things to take care of outside of this training, it has been challenging to do some research, think about how to deliver the contents to students and actually create teaching materials. It would be better if we could familiarise ourselves beforehand or would have several options of how to deliver the contents (teaching methods) already, so that we may be more efficient in dividing tasks and bringing individuals’ work together. </p>
                        <h3>Implementation of the lesson</h3>
                        <p>Using agree/ disagree button worked well. First I asked them to show agree or disagree for the two choice questions. Then I asked the students about the reason of their choice. Students were more active in discussion and giving their opinions. I reflect that it is because compared to speaking up through microphone, using button made students feel less challenging to express their opinions in the room. However, there might be possibility that students’ answers were affected by others. In my room, all the students chose the same answer (agree/ disagree) for two questions. This button methods is useful to create safe environments to share opinions in virtual learning environments, but as a teacher it is important to take it into account that the answers may be dominated by others. I would like to try the same methods in a bigger room to see whether the answers turn out to be still one-sided. Also I would like to explore the ways which allow students to choose answers from wider options (multiple-choice questions). </p>
                        <p>About myself, this time I was more confidence in teaching so that I could pay attention to students comments and make connections with my teaching. I tried to give feedback of students comments and re-use what students said, like “as Student A said,  ” or “as we learned in the previous lecture, ”. In this way, students are able to feel that they are heard and their comments are important. For me, it is also good way to keep motivation for the lecture. In addition, by connecting teaching with previous lessons, students can realise the relationships among topics which may deepen their understanding.</p>
