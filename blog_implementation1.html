							<span class="byline">17.09.2019, Online session</span>
						</header>
                        <h2>Learning from teaching</h2>
						<p>In the following section, I describe what our group has done for our teaching session and what I have learned from preparation and implementation processes.</p>
                        <h3>Topic<br>Safety in Virtual environments. (Safety, equality, network bullying, others, laws…) Consider both from the viewpoint of the student and the teacher.</h3>
						<h3>Preparation for the lesson</h3>
                        <p>We divided our tasks in the early stage, as we knew that we do not have many chances to have meeting. We created google slides and roughly structured. Each member added the pages for the assigned themes. But we needed someone to edit and finalise the slides to keep them coherence. In the process, we needed to remove a lot from individuals’ work because there were too many stuff for 45 minutes teaching session. Removed contents were added as “useful links” at the end of the presentation. Fortunately, all of us were very understanding and we did not have obvious conflicts about the result of editing, still I would like to think about the ways to make the process of creating lesson more effective. </p>
                        <p>One of the challenges we face is that not all of us are familiar with the topic and it is hard to guess what we are going to talk about before doing some research. As the time for teaching is only a week and we all have some other things to take care of outside of this training, it has been challenging to do some research, think about how to deliver the contents to students and actually create teaching materials. It would be better if we could familiarise ourselves beforehand or would have several options of how to deliver the contents (teaching methods) already, so that we may be more efficient in dividing tasks and bringing individuals’ work together. </p>
                        <h3>Implementation of the lesson</h3>
                        <p>Using agree/ disagree button worked well. First I asked them to show agree or disagree for the two choice questions. Then I asked the students about the reason of their choice. Students were more active in discussion and giving their opinions. I reflect that it is because compared to speaking up through microphone, using button made students feel less challenging to express their opinions in the room. However, there might be possibility that students’ answers were affected by others. In my room, all the students chose the same answer (agree/ disagree) for two questions. This button methods is useful to create safe environments to share opinions in virtual learning environments, but as a teacher it is important to take it into account that the answers may be dominated by others. I would like to try the same methods in a bigger room to see whether the answers turn out to be still one-sided. Also I would like to explore the ways which allow students to choose answers from wider options (multiple-choice questions). </p>
                        <p>About myself, this time I was more confidence in teaching so that I could pay attention to students comments and make connections with my teaching. I tried to give feedback of students comments and re-use what students said, like “as Student A said,  ” or “as we learned in the previous lecture, ”. In this way, students are able to feel that they are heard and their comments are important. For me, it is also good way to keep motivation for the lecture. In addition, by connecting teaching with previous lessons, students can realise the relationships among topics which may deepen their understanding.</p>
                        <h2>Learning from other groups</h2>
                        <h3>How can present Virtual Environments be made versatile and activating?</h3>
                        <h3>What traditional teaching methods work with Virtual Environments? What don’t? What features are better  in Virtual Environment (compared to frontal teaching — and why are they better)?</h3>
                        <p>(Last update: 17.9.2019)</p>
